# Power-Efficient SLAM for AR Glasses

Hello! :wave:

This is the project page for the project "Power-Efficient SLAM for AR Glasses"
in the 2025 WINLAB Summer Internship.

In this project, we aim to study how different on-device
recording configurations impact SLAM quality and power usage on AR glasses.
